RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a proven marketing model for behavior-based customer segmentation. It groups customers based on their transaction history â€“ how recently, how often, and how much they have purchased.

RFM helps divide customers into various categories or clusters to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions and also for future personalization services.
